                        For fans, having an account on sounds.sg will serve as a one-stop platform for easy browsing and discovering of music made by Singaporean artists, 
                        as well as providing the easy purchase of tracks from any artist on sounds.sg. Besides uninhibited access to the music available on sounds.sg, 
                        a fan account also allows the user to buy tracks and download them, with permanent access to the purchased tracks, as well as transaction information. 
                        With the fan account, the user is also able to create a wishlist of tracks that they would like to purchase, and coupled with the 'Featured Songs' playlist, 
                        this will facilitate the ease with which they can purchase the tracks. Buying will simply be a click away. Fans can show their support for the artists 
                        by purchasing their music, and also keep track with the artists by following their profile, which contains information provided by the artist, such as upcoming gig 
                        dates and venues. The fan account will also be notified whenever an artist they are following has uploaded new songs onto the site. Following the artist profile 
                        also allows the fan to receive unique rewards from the artist upon purchase of their tracks, from something as simple as a message of gratitude, to other rewards, 
                        depending on the artist. Signup for a fan account is free, anytime, anywhere.
