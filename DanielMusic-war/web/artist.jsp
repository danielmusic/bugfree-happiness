                        Sounds.sg functions primarily as a music archive for all music that comes from Singapore and from Singaporeans. 
                        Providing music and other content for local artists, sounds.sg is a one-stop, carry-all information platform for Singapore's music scene, 
                        where the emphasis is placed on the music. Sounds.sg does this through the use of 'Featured tracks', 
                        which will be a playlist of each artist's own featured track, played upon entering the site. 
                        The same track will also be played upon entering the artist's page, so fans get an instant taste of the artist's music and sound. 
                        The artist page contains all available music by the artist, as well as descriptive content and other information about the artist. 
                        Fans and visitors to the site are able to purchase the tracks of the artists on the site through the artist page as wel, and show support to their favourite artists by subscribing 
                        to their artist pages. As a dedicated site that loves and is proud of Singapore's music collage and landscape, we hope you will join with us and be a part of this dynamically
                        growing and vibrant fabric.

                    <h2>Page Management</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Sounds.sg fully appreciates the creative ability and talent of the artist, and so the artist has free reign over the content that is available on their artist page for fans to see. 
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        By allowing the artist to manage their own artist page and its content, the artist is able to preserve the intention and integrity of their work. 
                        The artist is in charge, and this way the art created is presented the way the artist would want it to be. 
                        With the artist page, new and curious people have access to the artist's music, detail information and descriptions at one go.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Signup is free, and the artist will be required to provide specific information, such as genre and bio/descriptions, in order to facilitate the categorization of songs for sounds.sg playlist creation. This also encourages the comprehensive nature of content on the artist page, so that fans can get to know the artists better. 
                        Artists will also choose a featured track (which can be changed), and this will be added to playlists curated by sounds.sg, such as genre playlists and the main playlist on the homepage.
                    </p>

                        At sounds.sg, the artist names the price of their songs. With every track purchased, the artist gets 70% of the earnings, 
                        while the rest goes to site maintenance and upkeep. Artists will also be notified every time someone purchases their songs, for keeping
                        track of sales as well as providing an opportunity to reach out to fans through their fan pages.
